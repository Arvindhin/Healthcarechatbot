# Health Care Chat-Bot 🤖
Project for the 7th Semester Subject -> Machine Learning

Health Care Chat-Bot is a Healthcare Domain Chatbot to simulate the predictions of a General Physician.

## Brief
A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.A chatbot is a type of software that can help customers by automating conversations and interact with them through messaging platforms. Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse, while none of them can pass the standard Turing test.The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.
